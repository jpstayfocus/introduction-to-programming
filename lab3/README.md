Lab 3
Using nested for loops, write a program that asks the user to enter two integers n and m. The program then asks the user to enter n lines of m numbers each, and calculates and outputs the sum of each line of m numbers. For example, if n = 3 and m = 4, A sample run would be (3 lines, 4 numbers per line):
```
Enter 4 numbers: 3 5 7 2
	Sum = 17
	Enter 4 numbers: 4 6 8 3
	Sum = 21
	Enter 4 numbers:  1 0 -2 9
	Sum = 8

```
