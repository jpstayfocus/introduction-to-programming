## Quiz 2

Write a program that:
1. Generates 10 random numbers between 5 and 15
2. Stores the generated numbers in a 1D array
3. Calculates and displays how many numbers are duplicated in the array (appear more than once). If a duplicate is found you are allowed to change its value
4. Calculates and displays  the sum of elements in the array without counting the duplicates more than once.

Example:
```
if Array is:  15 8 6 5 10 9 11 8 8 10
Number of duplicates :  2 (8 and 10)
Sum is : 15 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 10 + 9 + 11 = 64
```
