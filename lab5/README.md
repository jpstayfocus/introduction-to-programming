An magic square of order n is an n x n matrix that is filled with the distinct integers 1, 2, 3, â€¦, n2, such that the elements in each row, each column, and each diagonal sum up to the same constant (called the magic constant M = [n(n2 + 1)] / 2). The following is a magic square of order 4. It contains the numbers 1..16, such that all directions have equal sums (in this case 34).

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 3  | 2  | 13 |
| 5  | 10 | 11 | 8  |
| 9  | 6  | 7  | 12 |
| 4  | 15 | 14 |	1 |

Write a program that reads n2 values from the keyboard and test whether they form a magic square.

You will need functions such as:
```
void readSquare(int square[][5], int n)		
int leftRightDiagonalSum(int square[][5], int n)	
int rightLeftDiagonalSum(int square[][5], int n)
int columnSum(int square[][5], int n, int columnNumber)
int rowSum(int square[][5], int n, int rowNumber)
bool validMagicSquare(int square[][5], int n)
```
